Centre of Mass 
C3.3 
Candidates should be able to:
(a)
use the result that the effect of gravity on a rigid body is equivalent to a single force acting at 
the centre of mass of the body;
(b)
identify the position of the centre of mass of a uniform body using considerations of symmetry;
(c)
use given information about t
he position of the centre of mass of a triangular lamina and other 
simple shapes (including those listed in the List of Formulae);
(d)
determine the position of the centre of mass of a composite rigid body by considering an 
equivalent system of particles (in simple cases only, e.g. a uniform L
-shaped lamina or a 
hemisphere abutting a cylinder
