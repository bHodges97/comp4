Centre of Mass 
You should be able to:
(a)Use the result that the effect of gravity on a rigid body is equivalent to a single force acting atthe centre of mass of the body;
(b)Identify the position of the centre of mass of a uniform body using considerations of symmetry;
(c)Use given information about the position of the centre of mass of a triangular lamina and other simple shapes (including those listed in the List of Formulae);
(d)determine the position of the centre of mass of a composite rigid body by considering an equivalent system of particles (in simple cases only, e.g. a uniform L-shaped lamina or a hemisphere abutting a cylinder
