Projectile Motion
You should be able to:
(a)model the motion of a projectile as a particle moving with constant acceleration and understand any limitations of this model; 
(b)use horizontal and vertical equations of motion to solve problems on the motion of projectiles, including finding the magnitude and direction of the velocity at a given time or position, the range on a horizontal plane and the greatest height reached;
(c)derive and use the cartesian equation of the trajectory of a projectile, including problems in which the initial speed and/or angle of projection may be unknown.
